Analyses are organised by topic and are each contained in their own subdirectory in the `analysis` directory. All analysis are performed in the malariagen environment (full environtment available here https://github.com/malariagen/mgenv, most important dependencies listed in env.yaml) unless stated otherwise. We mostly used v.6.0. but newer versions should be largely compatible.
